# üè• Patient Readmission Prediction

## üß† Project Overview

This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to **predict whether a patient will be readmitted** to the hospital based on their medical and demographic data.

Using a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle, I applied key data science processes including data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## üß© My Contributions

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  - Handled missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent labels  
  - Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features  
  - Engineered new features to improve predictive power

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Visualized various data
  - Identified correlations and patterns across medical and demographic attributes

- **Modeling:**  
  - Applied and compared various machine learning algorithms including:
    - Ridge regression  
    - Decision Trees
    - XGB Regressor
    - Random Forest
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - K-means
    - DBSCAN

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
  - Validated models using train-test splits and cross-validation
